### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Issac (Zhifeng) Chen!
<br/>ðŸ”­ I'm a junior at UC Berkeley studying both Computer Science and Data Science 
<br/>ðŸŒ± I'm a research assistant at UC Berkeley's Space Science Laboratories on data processing and visualization software for NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. 
<br/>âœ¨ I was a software engineering intern in the Summer of 2023 for the software team at Excermatic (an anti-theft solutions company)

ðŸ’¬ Many of my projects from school and past internships are in my private repo as requested by UC Berkeley to preserve academic integrity. If you're a potential employer and would like to review my more complex projects, please email me at issaczf@berkeley.edu and I'm happy to share!

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a student pilot and a photographer!
